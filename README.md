# Defract

Made for Global Game Jam 2020. Theme: Repair. GGJ Entry: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/defract-6

A quick Unity prototype for a puzzle game of sorts: Restore the scene to its original state to reveal the original audio and visuals. Initially intended to be played in VR on the Quest but I did not get it to render on the device and so it never progressed beyond this in-editor prototype.

## How to Play ##
* Open the Main scene in the Unity project. This was made in 2019.2.19f1 but should work with most Unity versions before or after.
* Make sure you have a Scene view and a Game view but no Inspector.
* There are three objects in the scene: 1-beat, 2-bass, 3-guitar. Press Play and change their position, rotation and scale until it feels right.

## Music Credits ##

* Music created using https://www.boscaceoil.net/ developed by https://terrycavanaghgames.com/. Thanks Terry!
* Yes, this is a pretty horrible cover of Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes. =D
