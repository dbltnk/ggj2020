# Defract

Made for Global Game Jam 2020 
Theme: Repair

## How to Play ##
* Open the Main scene in the Unity project. This was made in 2019.2.19f1 but should work with most Unity versions before or after.
* Make sure you have a Scene view and a Game view but no Inspector.
* There are three objects in the scene: 1-beat, 2-bass, 3-guitar. Press Play and change their position, rotation and scale until it feels right.
